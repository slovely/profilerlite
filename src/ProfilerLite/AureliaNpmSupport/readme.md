# Aurelia NPM Support

This folder is basically a decompile of internal classes in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions` namespace 
which provide Angular support, modified to support Aurelia instead.  Aurelia will automatically start up when pressing 
F5 in VS or running `dotnet run`.  Calls on the dev server will be proxied to the Aurelia dev server.
